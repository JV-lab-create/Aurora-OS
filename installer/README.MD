### Aurora OS Installer
To create a disk that installs Aurora OS run:
`wget run https://github.com/JV-lab-create/Aurora-OS/blob/main/installer/diskmaker.lua`
to install it from disk. You also need to install basalt on a disk by running
`wget run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pyroxenium/Basalt/refs/heads/master/docs/install.lua release latest.lua` from the 
[Basalt 1.7 Wiki](https://pyroxenium.github.io/Basalt/#/home/download) The file must be copied to a disk, or it will not work.
